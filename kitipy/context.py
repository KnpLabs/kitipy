    ubiquitously run commands on local and remote targets, as well as the stack
    and stage objects loaded by task groups and the dispatcher used to update
    the CLI based on executor events.

    It's acting as a global Facade, such that you generally don't need to
    interact with other kitipy or click objects.

    As both kitipy and click exposes their own Context object, you might wonder
    what's the fundamental difference between them, here it is:

      * As said above, kitipy Context carry everything about how and where to
        execute shell commands, on either local or remote targets. As such, it
        has a central place in kitipy and is what you interact with within 
        kitipy tasks.
      * In the other hand, the click Context is here to carry details about CLI
        commands and options, and to actually parse and navigate the command
        tree made of kitipy tasks or regular click commands. As kitipy is a 
        super-set of click features, click.Context actually embeds the
        kitipy.Context object.

    You generally don't need to instantiate it by yourself, as this is
    handled by RootCommand which can be created through the kitipy.root()
    decorator.
